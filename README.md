# ACSE-5: Advanced Programming 2019/2020

## Getting started 
This module starts with a primer on C++ programming, and will teach you how to develop and build C++ programs. Students will be taught functions and input/output handling, as well as memory handling concepts such as pointers, memory allocation and advanced data structures such as linked lists and trees.

You will be taught practical skills for analysing software for potential bugs as well as quickly locating bugs when they arise using debuggers. Additionally, you will learn how to use profiling techniques to identify performance hotspots in software and gain a practical understanding of the factors that limit the performance of software.

This will be followed by an introduction to object-oriented programming with C++ including how to define and use classes, inheritance, overloaded functions and polymorphism.

These will all be taught in the context of scientific programming and numerical methods, with relevant examples and exercises being used to illustrate the programming concepts. Regular programming assignments will bring together all the skills that will be learned throughout the course and build upon the skills taught in the previous programming and numerical methods courses as part of the ACS MSc. 

## Learning outcomes:

On successful completion of this module, students will be able to:
1.	Write programs to solve scientific problems using C++.
2.	Analyse problems in order to solve them with algorithms and software.
3.	Analyse and identify opportunities for refining computer programmes.
4.	Manage contributions to group work co-ordinating and co-operating with peers.

## Get started

In preparation for your ACSE-5 lecture on “Advanced Programming” we have the following instructions/info:
- As part of our ACSE-5 we will be primarily using Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC), an IDE (integrated development environment) for the C++ programming language (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio). 
- The most basic edition of Visual Studio, the Community edition, is available free of charge. This is available for C++, for *Windows* only. Please notice that this is different from "Microsoft Visual Code" which is only an editor, and not an IDE.
- Please install Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 in your laptops (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). The installation may take a few hours. After you download the install program for Visual Studio 2017 and run it, you will be presented with a screen. Select the option to install "Desktop development with C++”. After installing MSVC make sure that you can create and save a file to a local folder.
- If you do not have a Windows system (Mac or Linux) OR if you cannot install MSVC for space or any other reason, please send me an email as soon as possible (apaluszn@imperial.ac.uk).
- During our first class, next Monday, we will make sure that everyone has access to the MSVC IDE, and we will get started on some simple IDE tasks to set us up for the term.

## Assignments and Evaluation

There will be two homeworks (not marked), one assignment (marked), and one individual, in-class, computer-based programming **final coursework** (marked). The homework should be completed after class during the afternoon sessions, these will not be collected nor assessed; you will receive GTA support to resolve these during afternoon sessions.

The homework and the assignment can be completed individually or in pairs, the final coursework will be individual. Submission will be via GitHub [details will follow].

1. Homework 1: Climate Change Focus: How can we predict temperature changes? ☀️🌤⛅️🌥☁️🌦🌧⛈🌩🌨
- Looking for a plotting solution? Try downloading [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info), and use this code to get started [CodeGNUPLOT](10gnuplot.cpp)

2. Homework 2: Implementing a medical imaging filter. 

3. Assignment: Implementing a linear solver. Due: 2nd of February @ midnight - early submissions welcome.

4. Final Coursework: The final piece of coursework will be to be completed in-class, and shall be submitted individually. You will be able to make use of all the code you have written for any previous assignments; you will also have access to the internet during the assignment. On: 27th of January.
